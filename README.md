# BCI

This project is an attempt at a machine learning based BCI. 
This will be using the Neurosky Force Trainer 2 headset (found on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Trainer-Brain-Sensing-Hologram-Electronic/dp/B00X5CCDYQ)) and interfacing via bluetooth.

Initial plans are to atttempt to detect the thought patterns of the 4 primary directions (up, down, left, right) and will later be expanded if the results prove fruitful.
